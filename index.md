# About cvc5

**cvc5** is an efficient open-source automatic theorem prover for
[Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)](
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_Modulo_Theories)
problems.
It can be used to prove the **satisfiability** (or, dually, the **validity**)
of first-order formulas in a large number of theories and their combination.
It further provides a [Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS)](https://sygus.org)
engine to synthesize functions with respect to background theories and their
combination.

**cvc5** is the successor of [CVC4](https://cvc4.cs.stanford.edu) and is
intended to be an open and extensible SMT engine.
It can be used as a stand-alone tool or as a library, with essentially no limit
on its use for research or commercial purposes (see
[license](https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5/blob/master/COPYING)).
